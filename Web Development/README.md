# Web Development

Web development refers to the building, creating, and maintaining of websites. All websites, at their most basic, are just a bunch of files stored on a computer called servers. Servers are computers that are used to host websites and are connected to the Internet. You can then load/view that website via internet through a browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) which are programs running on your computer or your phone. Your browser is also called the client in this situation. 

With any typical web application, there are two major components or codes running sconcurrently. These are:

- Client-side Code - Popularly known as frontend is the code that is in the browser and responds to some user input. The client component is a representation of a web applicationâ€™s functionality that the end-user interacts with. The client side component can be built using HTML, CSS and JS also using frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, Vue.js and so on. <br></br>
- Server-side Code - Popularly known as backend is the code that is on the server and responds to the HTTP requests. The server component has at least two parts; app logic and database. The former is the main control center of the web application while the latter is where all the persistent data is stored. The server component can be build using one or a combination of several programming languages and frameworks, including Java, .Net, NodeJS, PHP, Python, and Ruby on Rails

Web development would be an amazing place to start exporing the vast concepts of computer science. The following steps / resources that would be useful and sufficient to get started with web development.

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) : It contains tutorials for various concepts in web development. This is an excellent place to start and the HTML/CSS/JS tutorials are highly recommended.<br></br>
- [Full Stack Web Development , Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/full-stack-react) : Audit the courses under this specialization to explore various layers of web development using the MERN stack. Consist of 3 courses for Bootstrap, frontend using React and backend using Node, Express and MongoDB.  

Once you have learnt a particular web-stack then it would be quite easy to grasp and migrate to other frameworks like [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), [Angular](https://angular.io/) etc... Also, it is highly recommended to learn by creating simple projects like To-Do or blog apps and not just by viewing the tutorials.
