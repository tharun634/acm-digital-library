# Image Processing
Image Processing is a way of extracting certain features (like edges) of an image or enhancing an image using some operations. It is a type of signal processing in which the input is
an image or certain characteristics/features associated with an image.

It involves 3 basic steps:
* Importing an image via image acquistion tools
* Analysing and manipulating the image
* Get an output which is a modified form of the image or a report that is based on the image analysis

Resources to get started:
* [Image Processing with OpenCV](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-the-basics-of-digital-image-processing-and-computer-vision-using-opencv-8bc0e67243c8): A short article on how an image represented and the types of images along with an introduction to the most common tool for IP - OpenCV.
* [Digital Image Processing](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/117/105/117105135/): The nptel lecture series covers basics of image dgitization to colour image processing 
* [Image Processing Algorithms and tools](https://neptune.ai/blog/image-processing-in-python-algorithms-tools-and-methods-you-should-know): A short read that covers classic image
processing algorithms and tools (For anyone who is familiar with Neural Nets and Fourier).
