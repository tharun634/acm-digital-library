# Signal Processing
Signal Processing is a broad and evergrowing field concerned with the manipulation and analysis of both analog and digital signals. The technologies we use in our everyday lives–radios, video devices, cell phones, smart connected devices and more–are enabled by signal processing. 

Recently, machine learning techniques have been applied to aspects of signal processing, blurring the lines between the sciences, and causing many shared 
applications between the two.

Signal Processing requires strong basics in Signals and Systems and Fourier.
* The book [Signals and Systems by Oppenheim, Willisky, Hamid](https://github.com/poorvishm/acm-digital-library/blob/517e29fcb3c91519c8ea2beeabf0e319423b27a2/Signal%20Processing/Resources/Signals%20and%20Systems.pdf) along with [Oppenheim's MIT Lectures](https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-6-007-signals-and-systems-spring-2011/video-lectures/), will help in understanding the fundamentals. 

Once, the above concepts are clear, one can get started with Digital Signal Processing.
* [Digital Signal Processing](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/digital-signal-processing): This course starts from the basic concepts of discrete-time signals 
and proceeds towards data maniputation via digital filters and analog to digital conversion. Mainly focuses on audio signals. 
* [MIT OPEN COURSEWARE](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/find-by-topic/#cat=engineering&subcat=electricalengineering&spec=signalprocessing): This includes lecture videos, 
notes and assignments for a wide range of topics in Signal Processing covered in both undergraduate and graduate levels.
